# TheCreditCalculation_C

I created this project first in the C ++ programming language and now I changed the programming language to C.

This project is built in Code::Blocks IDE.

This project helps you to calculate the loan amount according to the interest rate and the interest. 

Then you can find the total amount per month, which you have to pay the bank.

When you want to know this information, you just enter the interest rate, the interest and the number of months.
